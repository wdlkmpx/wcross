If a .sbuild is not prefixed by lib* then
- it's the original package name
- it provides tools that can go to PKGDIR (some symlinked sbuilds)

If a package was renamed to libXXX it's because it only
provides a lib and that way it's easier to identify as a package
that only provides libs
 (in most cases pkgname= still retains the original package name)
