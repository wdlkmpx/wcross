Discarded apps
==============
 - cmus (too much work to make it work)
 - file (libmagic)
     * compatibility issues with older libmagic databases
     * so basically file is unusable in old distros
     * libmagic requires a database that is not linked statically
 - opencl (libopencl)
     * this is about dynamically loading opencl implementations

ncurses apps
============
 - optical/cdw

Known C++ projects
==================
 - 7z
